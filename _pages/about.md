I'm a third year Ph.D. student from [School of Mathematics](http://math.hit.edu.cn/main.htm), [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn). My research interest includes descriptor linear systems, robust pole assignment, parametric eigenstructure assignment and data-driven control.

You can find my CV here: [Lingyu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV_ZLY.pdf).
